**Abstract:**  
**Plasmonic resonances** have garnered significant interest in fields such as optics, magneto-optics, and photonics due to their potential applications in biosensing, telecommunications, and microscopy. In the specific case of **nanoellipsoids** illuminated within the visible spectrum, dipolar plasmonic resonances can be distinguished from other types of excitations by analytically solving the problem of light scattering and absorption in the **quasistatic regime**. The distinction between the origins of possible resonances is achieved by employing a formulation of the dielectric function that separates the **intraband** and **interband** electronic contributions of the material composing the nanoellipsoid. In this work, the plasmonic response of nanoellipsoids made of real materials is theoretically studied under the quasistatic approximation by analytically solving Laplace's equation in confocal ellipsoidal coordinates. Models reported in the literature, fitted to experimental data of the **dielectric function** for various materials, are used to identify the two types of contributions, and **size-dependent corrections** relevant at the nanoscale are incorporated. From the calculation of the extinction cross-section and comparison with the limiting case of a nanosphere, the excitation frequencies of the dipolar plasmon resonance and their spectral shifts are identified as a function of the nanoellipsoid's geometric parameters. Furthermore, the effect of intraband contributions to the dielectric function on the excited dipolar plasmon resonance in the nanoellipsoid is discussed. The results make it possible to identify whether the detected resonances have a plasmonic origin.
